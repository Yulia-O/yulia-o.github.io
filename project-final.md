## Description
<p class="message">
  Watching “Avatar: The Last Airbender (Avatar: The Legend of Aang', where some people were able to manipulate the classical elements by use of psychokinetic variants of Chinese martial arts, known as "bending", I was inspired by this beautiful journey through the four main elements that are so basic and universal to all of us. 

The app idea is to teach users about <b>Classical Element approach</b> that describes the simplest form of existence, of everything in existence. </p>
<p>Target audience: anyone who is interested to know more about words, images, sensations, or characters associated with main basic elements.
Users can click on the element buttons and see the screens (scroll views) associated with selected element. 
If user wants to share this information he can click “SEND IT” button and send email to the friend.

Summary: Classical elements typically refer to Ancient Greek concepts, such as those of Empedocles, similar to the modern states of matter: earth (solid), water (liquid), air (gas) and fire (plasma). Aristotle added a fifth element or quintessence (after "quint" meaning "fifth") called aether in Ancient Greece, and akasha in India. The concept of the five elements formed a basis of analysis in both Hinduism and Buddhism. In Hinduism, particularly in an esoteric context, the four states-of-matter describe matter, and a fifth element describes that which was beyond the material world. Similar lists existed in ancient China and Japan. In Buddhism the four great elements, to which two others are sometimes added, are not viewed as substances, but as categories of sensory experience.

Classical elements. Certain words and images associated with each element.

## Design 
<p class="message">
   Use pen-and-paper to sketch out the app screens before you write a single line of code. Take a picture of the card and share it in this section.
</p>

## Development
<p class="message">
  Task: Build the screens out using the Designer UI. Write the Java code to handle the interactions. Create a README file for your project. Add comments to your code. Take a screenshot of the working app screens and share them in this section.
</p>
